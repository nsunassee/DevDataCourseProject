Simple Shiny Application
----
This presentation, created using R Markdown, is the assignment for Week 4 of the Developing Data Products course.

This project has two parts: a Shiny application deployed on Rstudio's servers, and a presentation created using Slidify.

The Shiny app, hosted on RStudio's Shinyapps server: https://nsunassee.shinyapps.io/DevDataCourseProject/

The Shiny app source code, on my GitHub: https://github.com/nsunassee/DevDataCourseProject

What is your BMI?
----
Body Mass Index is an estimate of the body fat of a person, calculated using their height and weight.

The formula is BMI = kg/m2, with the weight in kg and m2 is their height in metres squared. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 24.9. Should your BMI be over 25, this may indicate that you are overweight.

      
Embedded Code      
----
```r{}
BMI <- function(weight,height) {
  weight/(height^2)
}
```

Disclaimer
----
While BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years, please note that this result is indicative only.
Please consult your medical practitioner for further information.
